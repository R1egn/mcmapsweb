# The web frontend to view stiched together mcmaps.

## Bugs
1. Layout maps clean without having to drag around. This is a javascript 
   change, something on the page load.

## TODO
1. Move around while swapping maps in/out of the browser window 
   automatically in the background. Need to keep track of blocks that 
   are visible and when they leave the screen then add more to the side.
1. Add option to go to coords.
1. Move scripts to their own file? (\*.js?)
1. Add ability to rotate map.
1. Add ability to name places??? (That's a big deal.)

## DONE
1. Create website using Apache at chloe using default web port. It can 
   default to the share directory /home/share/mcmap/draw9.html.
1. Can drag the map around like google maps.
1. Add to github.
1. Move into project including \*.sh for creating the maps.
1. Format this file
