# Scripts to create maps of a Minecraft world.

## NOTE
This process is generally working good enough. Should focus on the [web front 
end](./web/README.md).

## TODO
1. **Make sure the scripts still work.** 2022-01-04 They do not.
1. Schedule the process that makes the maps. (Bi-monthly to start.)
1. Generalize the scripts.
1. Finalize the names of these processes.
1. Update the comments in the scripts to make sure they are accurate.
1. Outline what each script does. Perhaps graph it.
1. Add link to original mcmaps. <https://github.com/spoutn1k/mcmap>
1. Merge web front end into this project.

### DONE
1. Remove hardlinked scripts that are stored all over the file system and put 
   everything where it belongs.
1. Use all relative paths in scripts where possible.
1. Move images into image directory.
1. Move the scripts into this dir.  (They are hardlinked for now.)
1. Create a git repo.
1. Add repo to github.
