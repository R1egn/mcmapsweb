# Scripts to create maps of a Minecraft world.

## NOTE
This process is generally working good enough. Should focus on the [web front 
end][./web/README.md].

## TODO
1. Make sure the scripts still work.
1. Schedule the process that makes the maps. (Weekly to start.)
1. Generalize the scripts.
1. Finalize the names of these processes.
1. Remove hardlinked scripts.
1. Outline what each script does. Perhaps graph it.
1. Add link to original mcmaps.

### DONE
1. Move the scripts into this dir.  (They are hardlinked for now.)
1. Create a git repo.
1. Add repo to github.
